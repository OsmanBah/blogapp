	<h3>The Night I Loved Her All Over Again</h3>

<div class="top-section">
	<p class="intro">
	<br>It started out with the infatuation of her reflection. Her eyes pierced the mirror and beamed back a luminous glow. Her skin was black, fresh and tout. Her lips were full like a slice of orange. I knew I was already in love with her, but she loved herself a great deal more.<br>
	<br>But that all seemed to change that night we sat down watching one punch man. Its a marvel watching her take in so much of my mindless entertainment. I enjoyed it more than she thinks. She did it for me and enjoyed it. It made me tell myself that I had to buck up. Its not everyday a guy ends up with gorgeous girl and she ends up being everything you asked for. Some guys aren't that lucky. But when I looked into those eyes of hers, I saw something. She was completely in my world. She looked happy there. Comfortable even. Then I felt her head on my chest. Her chuckles would tickle me as Saitama gives the Sea King another one of his famous blank stares. That's the night I loved her all over again.<br>

 <h3>I wrote a poem for you:</h3>  


<div class="middle-section">
	<br>Roses are red, <br>
	<br>Apple are red too. <br>
	<br>But sometimes they are green. <br>
	<br>And sometimes poop is too. <br>
	<br>I know I rhymed too with too and its cool, <br>
	<br>because everything makes sense, <br>
	<br>Now that I love you. <br>
</div>

	<h3><a href="">Now Me:</a></h3>
	<p>
		When a man exceeds manhood he becomes a gentleman. This is the ultimate goal. There are rules governing the ascension.
	</p>
	<p>They are: </p>

	<ol>
		<li>Always get your affairs sorted out. Never leave a mess.</li>
		<li>When on top, do not gloat. No one loves a soar winner.</li>
		<li>Always keep your word. </li>
	</ol>

<p>I am none of the above unfortunately. I try to be as dignified as possible. I try to have fun wherever I am. (Rule 9). But I think I have a long way to go to become a proper gentleman. I'm into things like movies, tech, art, fashion and architecture. My character and choices I make needs to improve.
